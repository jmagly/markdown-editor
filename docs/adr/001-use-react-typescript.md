# ADR-001: Use React with TypeScript

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework for building a modern markdown editor with live preview capabilities. The application requires:
- Component-based architecture
- Strong type safety
- Good ecosystem support
- Performance for real-time updates
- Easy state management integration

## Decision
We will use React 18 with TypeScript for the frontend framework.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Large ecosystem**: Extensive libraries and community support
- **Type safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
- **Performance**: React 18's concurrent features handle real-time updates well
- **Component reusability**: Easy to create modular, reusable components
- **Developer experience**: Excellent tooling and debugging support
- **Hiring**: Large pool of React developers available

### Negative
- **Bundle size**: React adds ~45KB gzipped to the bundle
- **Learning curve**: TypeScript adds complexity for new developers
- **Boilerplate**: More setup code compared to vanilla JavaScript

### Neutral
- Virtual DOM approach is well-suited for our use case
- Hooks API provides clean state management patterns

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Vue.js**: Smaller bundle size but smaller ecosystem
2. **Svelte**: Better performance but less mature ecosystem
3. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Smaller size but more complex to maintain
