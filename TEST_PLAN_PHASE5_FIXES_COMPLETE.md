# Test Plan - Phase 5 Fixes Complete

## Overview
This test plan validates all fixes implemented based on QA feedback from TEST_PLAN_PHASE5_FIXES.md

## Test Environment
- URL: http://localhost:5174/
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera
- Test on both Windows/Linux (Ctrl) and Mac (Cmd)

## Fixed Issues Summary

### 1. ✅ App-Level Shortcuts When Editor Focused
**Issue**: App shortcuts (Copy/Export/Command Palette) were ignored when cursor was in editor
**Fix**: Modified keyboard shortcut handler to properly handle app-level shortcuts regardless of focus

### 2. ✅ Code Block Formatting in HTML Copy
**Issue**: Code blocks didn't have special formatting when copied as HTML
**Fix**: Added inline styles to code blocks for proper formatting in rich text applications

### 3. ✅ Nested List Indentation
**Issue**: Nested lists didn't maintain indentation in plain text copy
**Fix**: Enhanced plain text processor to handle nested lists with proper indentation

### 4. ✅ Table Formatting
**Issue**: Tables needed better plain text formatting
**Fix**: Improved table conversion with proper header detection and markdown-style formatting

### 5. ✅ Blockquote Excessive Lines
**Issue**: Blockquotes had excessive empty lines
**Fix**: Added trimming and filtering to remove extra lines from blockquotes

### 6. ✅ Modal Theme Consistency
**Issue**: Empty content warnings had inconsistent styling between modals
**Fix**: Updated Export modal to use same warning style as Copy modal

### 7. ✅ Modal Tab Focus Accessibility
**Issue**: Tab focus required manual click before working in modals
**Fix**: Added automatic focus management and focus trapping to modals

## Detailed Test Cases

### 1. App-Level Shortcuts in Editor

**Test Steps:**
1. Click in the editor textarea and start typing
2. With cursor still in editor, test these shortcuts:
   - Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Y (Copy Modal)
   - Ctrl/Cmd + E (Export Modal)
   - Ctrl/Cmd + K (Command Palette) #QA: CMD+K conflicts with editor shortcut for link
   - Ctrl/Cmd + / (Help Modal)
   - Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D (Toggle Dark Mode)

**Expected:**
- [ ] All app shortcuts work even when editor is focused
- [X] Editor shortcuts (Bold/Italic/Link) still work correctly
- [ ] No conflicts between editor and app shortcuts

### 2. HTML Copy with Code Formatting

**Test Content:**
```markdown
# Code Examples

Inline code: `const example = true`

```javascript
function testFormatting() {
  console.log("This should have formatting");
  return { status: "formatted" };
}
```

```python
def test_formatting():
    print("Python code block")
    return {"status": "formatted"}
```
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Add test content to editor
2. Open Copy Modal (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Y)
3. Click "HTML" option
4. Paste into Word/Google Docs

**Expected:**
- [ ] Code blocks have gray background
- [ ] Code blocks use monospace font
- [ ] Inline code has light gray background
- [ ] Proper padding and rounded corners

##QA: it seems this is not really working at all, we are getting properly indented content, that may be the best we can hope for for rich text?

### 3. Plain Text Copy with Nested Lists

**Test Content:**
```markdown
# List Tests

## Unordered Lists
- Level 1 item
- Another level 1
  - Level 2 item
  - Another level 2
    - Level 3 item
- Back to level 1

## Ordered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Sub-item A
   2. Sub-item B
      1. Sub-sub-item
3. Third item
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Add test content
2. Copy as plain text
3. Paste into Notepad/TextEdit

**Expected:**
- [X] Unordered lists show bullets (•)
- [X] Ordered lists show numbers
- [X] Each nested level has 2-space indentation
- [X] Proper spacing between items

### 4. Table Formatting Test

**Test Content:**
```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Row 2    | More     | Content  |
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Add table to editor
2. Copy as plain text
3. Check formatting

**Expected:**
- [X] Headers preserved with separator line
- [X] Columns aligned with pipes (|)
- [X] Readable table structure

### 5. Blockquote Formatting

**Test Content:**
```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> with multiple lines
> that should format correctly

Regular text here

> Another blockquote
```

**Expected:**
- [X] Each line prefixed with "> "
- [X] No excessive empty lines
- [X] Proper spacing between blockquotes

### 6. Modal Theme Consistency

**Test Steps:**
1. Clear editor content
2. Open Export Modal
3. Open Copy Modal
4. Compare warning styling

**Expected:**
- [X] Both modals show yellow warning box
- [X] Consistent icon and text styling
- [X] Dark mode colors match

### 7. Modal Accessibility

**Test Steps:**
1. Open any modal (Export, Copy, Help, Command Palette)
2. Press Tab without clicking inside modal
3. Continue pressing Tab to cycle through elements
4. Press Shift+Tab to go backwards
5. Press Escape to close

**Expected:**
- [X] Focus automatically moves to first focusable element
- [X] Tab cycles through all interactive elements
- [X] Tab wraps at beginning/end of modal
- [X] Escape closes modal
- [X] Focus returns to trigger element after close

## Regression Tests

### Original Phase 5 Features

### Core Functionality
- [X] Editor accepts input normally
