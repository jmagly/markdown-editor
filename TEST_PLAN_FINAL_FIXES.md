# Test Plan - Final Fixes

## Overview
This test plan validates the final fixes implemented based on the remaining issues from TEST_PLAN_PHASE5_FIXES_COMPLETE.md

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Ctrl/Cmd+K Shortcut Conflict Resolution
**Issue**: Ctrl/Cmd+K conflicted between editor link insertion and command palette
**Fix**: Modified shortcut handler to use context - Ctrl+K inserts link when in editor, opens command palette when not in editor

### 2. ✅ Enhanced HTML Copy Code Formatting
**Issue**: Code blocks weren't showing formatting when pasted into rich text editors
**Fix**: Added more comprehensive inline CSS with !important flags and additional styling properties

### 3. ✅ Focus-Based Synchronized Scrolling
**Issue**: Scrolling preview didn't sync back to editor, then bidirectional sync caused feedback loop
**Fix**: Implemented focus-based sync - only the pane with focus/hover controls the other

## Test Cases

### 1. Ctrl/Cmd+K Context-Aware Behavior

**Test Steps:**
1. Click in the editor and place cursor between text
2. Press Ctrl/Cmd+K
3. Verify link syntax is inserted
4. Click outside editor (on preview or header)
5. Press Ctrl/Cmd+K
6. Verify command palette opens

**Expected:**
- [X] In editor: Inserts `[](url)` at cursor position
- [X] Outside editor: Opens command palette
- [X] No conflicts or unexpected behavior

#### QA: it is expected to be able to open the commands from the editor as well, will need to change one of the shortcuts, lets change the one for the link
### 2. Enhanced Code Block Formatting

**Test Content:**
```markdown
# Code Formatting Test

Inline code: `const test = "formatted"`

```javascript
// This should have background and formatting
function testCodeBlock() {
  const features = {
    background: "gray",
    font: "monospace",
    border: "visible"
  };
  return features;
}
```

```python
# Python example
def test_formatting():
    """This should also be formatted"""
    return {"status": "formatted", "style": "preserved"}
```
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Add test content to editor
2. Open Copy Modal (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Y)
3. Click "HTML" option
4. Paste into:
   - Microsoft Word
   - Google Docs
   - Apple Pages (if available)
   - Rich text email editor

**Expected Results:**

#### Code Blocks Should Have:
- [X] Gray background (#f3f4f6)
- [X] Visible border
- [X] Monospace font (Consolas, Monaco, or Courier)
- [X] Proper padding/spacing
- [X] Rounded corners

#### Inline Code Should Have:
- [X] Light gray background (#e5e7eb)
- [X] Monospace font
- [X] Small padding
- [X] Distinct from regular text

**Note**: Some applications may strip certain styles. The goal is best-effort formatting preservation. If basic formatting (font family, background) is preserved, consider it successful.

### 3. Focus-Based Scroll Sync

**Test Steps:**
1. Add content that exceeds viewport height in both editor and preview
2. Test editor → preview sync:
   - Click in editor or hover over it
   - Scroll editor to middle
   - Verify preview scrolls to corresponding position
   - Scroll editor to bottom
   - Verify preview follows
3. Test preview → editor sync:
   - Click on preview pane or hover over it
   - Scroll preview to top
   - Verify editor scrolls to top
   - Scroll preview to specific heading
   - Verify editor shows corresponding markdown
4. Test focus switching:
   - Scroll editor while it has focus
   - Move mouse to preview (or click it)
   - Scroll preview
   - Verify no fighting/jittering occurs

**Expected:**
- [X] Only focused/hovered pane controls scrolling
- [X] Smooth synchronized scrolling
- [X] No scroll loops or jittering
- [X] Focus indication clear (hover or click)
- [X] Proportional scrolling (not 1:1 pixel)

### 4. Edge Cases

#### 4.1 Rapid Scroll Switching
**Test:**
1. Scroll editor quickly
2. Immediately scroll preview
3. Switch back and forth rapidly

**Expected:**
- [X] No infinite scroll loops
- [X] Stable behavior
- [X] Last scroll action takes precedence

#### 4.2 Different Content Heights
**Test:**
1. Have short content in editor that renders tall in preview (many headers, lists)
2. Test scrolling both directions

**Expected:**
- [X] Proportional scrolling maintained
- [ ] End positions align (bottom to bottom) #QA: slight mismatch due to relative doc sizes, we should snap top/bottom when reached on eitehr side

## Browser Compatibility

Test all fixes in:
- [X] Chrome/Edge
- [X] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if available)
- [X] Opera

## Regression Verification

Ensure previous fixes still work:
- [X] All app shortcuts work when editor focused
- [X] Plain text copy has proper list formatting
- [X] Table formatting in plain text
- [X] Modal focus management
- [X] Theme consistency

## Performance

- [X] No lag in scroll sync
- [X] Copy operations remain instant
- [X] Shortcut response immediate
- [X] No memory leaks with extended use

## Sign-off Criteria

All critical features must work:
- [X] Ctrl/Cmd+K works correctly based on context
- [X] Code formatting visible in at least 2 rich text applications
- [X] Bidirectional scroll sync smooth and reliable
- [X] No regressions from previous fixes

## Notes for QA

1. **Code Formatting**: Different applications handle HTML paste differently. Focus on whether formatting is better than plain text, not perfect replication
2. **Scroll Sync**: The sync is proportional, not pixel-perfect. This is intentional for better UX
3. **Shortcuts**: Test with both Ctrl (Windows/Linux) and Cmd (Mac) modifiers
